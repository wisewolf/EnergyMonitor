To upload the code to an ESP8266-01 you'll need an FTDI programmer (or similar).
You can buy one from eBay (http://goo.gl/6YNpvP).

When connecting the programmer to the ESP8266-01, be careful to use 3.3v only.

Wiring:

    RX -> TX
    TX -> RX
    CH_PD -> 3.3V
    GPIO 0 -> GND
    VCC -> 3.3V
    GND -> GND
